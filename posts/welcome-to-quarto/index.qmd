## A New Beginning

Welcome to the revamped **Life After Coding** blog! I'm excited to share that this site has been completely rebuilt using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a modern scientific and technical publishing system that brings together the best of reproducible research and web publishing.

## Why Quarto?

After using Jekyll for a while, I decided to migrate to Quarto for several compelling reasons:

### üî¨ **Scientific Computing Integration**
Quarto seamlessly integrates with Python, R, Julia, and Observable, making it perfect for data-driven blog posts and technical tutorials.

### üìù **Markdown-First Approach**
Write in familiar Markdown syntax while having access to powerful extensions for citations, cross-references, and advanced formatting.

### üé® **Beautiful Themes**
Built-in support for responsive, accessible themes that look great on any device.

### üîÑ **Reproducible Content**
Execute code blocks during rendering to ensure examples always work and outputs stay current.

## What's New?

Here's what you can expect from the new blog:

- **Enhanced readability** with improved typography and layout
- **Better code highlighting** and execution capabilities
- **Interactive elements** for data visualizations
- **Improved search functionality**
- **Mobile-optimized** responsive design

## Sample Code Block

Here's a simple Python example to demonstrate Quarto's code execution capabilities:

```python
# A simple Python example
import datetime

def get_blog_stats():
    return {
        "launch_date": "2025-08-10",
        "platform": "Quarto",
        "status": "Ready to rock! üöÄ"
    }

stats = get_blog_stats()
print(f"Blog launched on {stats['launch_date']} using {stats['platform']}")
print(f"Status: {stats['status']}")
```

## Coming Soon

I'm planning several exciting content series:

1. **Quarto Deep Dives** - Comprehensive tutorials on using Quarto for various projects
2. **Data Science Workflows** - End-to-end data analysis tutorials
3. **Career Transitions** - Insights on navigating the tech industry
4. **Tool Reviews** - Honest reviews of development tools and services
